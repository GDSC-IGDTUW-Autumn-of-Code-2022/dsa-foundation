## Why DSA?
Today's World contains lots and lots of data. When you need to deal with the data you must store it somewhere, and storing it doesn’t finish our work right? Because you need to fetch it whenever it is required and perform related operations on it. In what way you store your data has a lot to deal with how fast you can fetch and work on it. If you give your data a proper structure, we can easily perform the required operations on it.

Let us consider Facebook, have you ever wondered how will it work in the background? and how can it show the mutual friends? and all. It is because of the DSA behind the code. For finding mutual friends, can you guess what data structure is used? It is graphs, and with the help of graphs we can work on the connections.
Moreover, it is one of the most important topics to crack the interviews and online assessments for product-based companies.

The data structures used to solve the problems in this repo will be from basics like arrays, and strings to advanced topics like trees and linked lists.
