Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. Note that the overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n))

Example:

Input:

nums1 = [1,3]
nums2 = [2,4]

Output:
2.50000

Explanation:
Merged array = [1,2,3,4]
Median = (2+3)/2 = 2
