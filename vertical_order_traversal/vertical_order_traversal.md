Given a binary tree, print it vertically. 

NOTE: If there are multiple nodes at the same point, then print them in sorted order.

Examples:

Input:         1
               /    \ 
             2      3
           / \    /   \
        4   11 6    7
                      /  \  
                    8   9  
Output: [ [4], [2], [1, 6, 11], [3, 8], [7], [9] ]
Explanation: Traversing the tree vertically gives the above output.

Input:          5
               /  \ 
             4      6
           / \    /   
           3  1   2
Output: [ [3], [4], [1, 2, 5], [6] ]
